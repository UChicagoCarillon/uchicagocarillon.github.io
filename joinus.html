				<p> The Guild of Carillonists hosts auditions for new members through the course of the Autumn Quarter each year. All students registered in academic programs at the University of Chicago with three more years left in the program are eligible to audition. Hence, the audition is open to first- and second-year students in the College, as well as graduate students in various programs.</p>
				<br>
				<p> The audition process takes six weeks in total, with students registering at the end of the RSO fair Friday of Week 1 of the Autumn Quarter. Students will then be paired up with a teacher for weekly, 30-minute, one-on-one lessons in the next 5 weeks. We do not expect students to have any previous experience in carillon or other instruments, including the piano. However, they must be able to read both treble and bass clefs when lessons begin. During these 5 weeks, students will have access to the Carillon Studio in the Rockefeller Chapelâ€™s basement where they can practice on their own. </p> 
				<br>
				<p> Auditions will take place on a Sunday in Week 6 or 7 of the quarter. The Audition will consist of two parts - a prepared audition piece and a short sight-reading portion. Students will choose and prepare an audition piece with their teachers towards the latter half of their 5-week lessons. Students will also be provided with sight-reading exercises similar to the ones used in auditions beforehand to prepare. </p>
				<br>
				<p>Please contact the Guild for any questions or detailed information. </p>
				<br>
