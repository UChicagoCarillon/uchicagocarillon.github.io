				<p> The Guild of Carillonists hosts auditions for new members during Autumn Quarter every year. All students registered in academic programs at the University of Chicago with three or more years left in the program are eligible to audition. Hence, the audition is open to first- and second-year students in the College, as well as any graduate students who fulfill the above criteria.</p>
				<br>
				<p> The audition process takes five weeks in total. Students register by the end of second week. They will then be paired up with a teacher for weekly, 30-minute, one-on-one lessons in the next five weeks. We do not expect students to have any previous experience in carillon or other instruments, including the piano. However, they must be able to read both treble and bass clefs when lessons begin or be willing to learn on their own during the auditions process. During these five weeks, students will have access to the carillon studio in the Rockefeller Chapelâ€™s basement where they can practice on their own. </p> 
				<br>
				<p> Auditions will take place on a Sunday in Week 7 of the quarter. The Audition will consist of two parts - a prepared audition piece and a short sight-reading portion. Students will choose and start preparing an audition piece with their teachers during the third week of lessons. Students will also be provided with sight-reading exercises similar to the ones used in auditions beforehand to prepare. </p>
				<br>
				<p> Please contact the Guild for any questions or detailed information. </p>
				<br>
